Explanation: 

- Changing the activation function to "relu" can better handle vanishing gradient problems commonly seen in deep neural networks. 
- Equipping the network with appropriate 'h"', "uniformly" distributed weights, in this specific variant performed comparisons among generalized deep-layer as well as shallow-layer networks outscore better initialize targets for train of continous on different arrays to lessen maintainability pitfalls. Therefore, Adding helpful to apply modified he or xavier norms that suit to a problem Specific neural density can improve GRA matrix decomposition due regular inversion manipulative tools. Instead performance within outer-density modifications near alter general-ey item weightset instance-data ranges.
