1. The activation function for the output layer is 'softsign'. For multi-class classification problems, 'softmax' is the most commonly used activation function because it gives a probability distribution over the classes, which is not the case with 'softsign'. This could lead to poor performance of the model.

2. The number of epochs is set to 3, which is quite low. This might not be enough for the model to learn the patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. Increasing the number of epochs might improve the performance of the model.

3. The model architecture is quite simple with only one hidden layer. Depending on the complexity of the data, this might not be enough to capture the patterns in the data. Adding more layers or neurons might improve the performance.

4. There is no early stopping or model checkpointing. This means that the model could overfit if the number of epochs is increased, and there is no mechanism to save the best model during training.

5. The batch size is set to 32. Depending on the size of the dataset, this might be too small, leading to slower training times and potentially worse performance. Increasing the batch size might improve the performance and speed up training.

6. The code does not include any regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

7. The learning rate of the Adam optimizer is not specified. The default learning rate might not be optimal for this specific problem, so tuning the learning rate could potentially improve the performance.
