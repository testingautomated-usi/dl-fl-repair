6. The model does not use any data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation can help improve the model's performance by providing more varied training data.

7. The validation split is done after the normalization of the data. It is a better practice to split the data first and then normalize the training set and apply the same normalization parameters to the validation set. This is to ensure that the model does not get any information from the validation set during training.
