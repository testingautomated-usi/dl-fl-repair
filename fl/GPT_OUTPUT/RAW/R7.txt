1. The activation function for the output layer is 'linear', which is not suitable for a multi-class classification problem like MNIST. The 'softmax' activation function would be a better choice as it gives a probability distribution over the target classes.

2. The number of epochs is set to 12, which might not be enough for the model to learn the patterns in the data. Increasing the number of epochs might improve the performance.

3. The optimizer used is 'Adadelta'. While this is not necessarily a problem, it might be worth experimenting with other optimizers like 'Adam' or 'RMSprop' to see if they yield better results.

4. The model architecture might not be optimal. While the current architecture (two convolutional layers followed by a dense layer) is a common choice for image classification tasks, it might be worth experimenting with different architectures (e.g., adding more convolutional layers, changing the number of filters in each layer, etc.) to see if they yield better results.

5. The batch size is set to 128. While this is a common choice, it might be worth experimenting with different batch sizes to see if they yield better results. A smaller batch size might lead to a more robust model, while a larger batch size might lead to faster training.

6. The dropout rates are set to 0.25 and 0.5. While these are common choices, it might be worth experimenting with different dropout rates to see if they yield better results. Too high a dropout rate might lead to underfitting, while too low a dropout rate might lead to overfitting.

3. The optimizer used is 'Adadelta'. While this is not necessarily a problem, it might be worth experimenting with other optimizers like 'Adam' which is known to perform well in many scenarios.

4. There is no early stopping or model checkpointing. This means that the model could overfit to the training data, and we would not be able to retrieve the best model on the validation data.

5. The model architecture itself might not be optimal. While the provided architecture (two convolutional layers followed by a dense layer) is a reasonable starting point for an image classification task, it might be worth experimenting with more or fewer layers, different types of layers (e.g., adding batch normalization), or different hyperparameters within the layers (e.g., number of filters in the convolutional layers, dropout rate).

5. The batch size is set to 128. This is a reasonable choice, but it might be worth experimenting with different batch sizes to see if they affect the performance.

6. There is no data augmentation, which can help improve the model's performance by providing more varied training data.

7. There is no early stopping or model checkpointing, which can help prevent overfitting and ensure that the best model is saved.

2. The optimizer used is 'Adadelta'. While this is not necessarily a problem, it might not be the best choice for this problem. 'Adam' is often a better choice as it combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent: AdaGrad and RMSProp.

3. The number of epochs is set to 12. This might not be enough for the model to learn the patterns in the data. Increasing the number of epochs might improve the performance of the model.
